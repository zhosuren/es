Shooters' Forum20101121&ensp&#0183&enspGrizzlys are chinese junk.I have a friend with one and it is a sloppy piece of trash.Buy an older bridgeport and a southbend lathe.Parts are all over the internet and on the ebay.You will get a rigid beatiful older lathe capable of real tolerance's that can be repeatable and trusted to do it.This is what I did.I bought a 13 inch southbend took it all apart and restored it.It works beautiful.
