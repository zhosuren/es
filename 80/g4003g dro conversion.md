This 13&quot x 40&quot workhorse is a great addition to our line of spectacular Grizzly Gunsmithing Lathes.Supplied with an 8speed gearhead,2 HP motor,D14 spindle (with a generous 1.57&quot bore),flood coolant system,halogen worklight,pullout chip tray,and foot brake—great for safety!Lathe or Mill for Form 1 Projects and beyond Page 12016810&ensp&#0183&enspI think the question is,would a Grizzly machine be good enough (remember,perfection is the enemy of good enough).I'm not sure I'd need to do a belt drive conversion and a DRO upgrade on a lathe anyways since it's already belt driven,and I don't generally make complex shapes on lathes or have hole patterns that are tolerance critical.

Shooters' Forum20101121&ensp&#0183&enspGrizzlys are chinese junk.I have a friend with one and it is a sloppy piece of trash.Buy an older bridgeport and a southbend lathe.Parts are all over the internet and on the ebay.You will get a rigid beatiful older lathe capable of real tolerance's that can be repeatable and trusted to do it.This is what I did.I bought a 13 inch southbend took it all apart and restored it.It works beautiful.
