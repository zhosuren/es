## A Repeated Loading Triaxial Test Study on Resilient
The RLT test results demonstrate that resilient modulus of graded crushed stone remarkably increases with decreasing moisture content and or increasing confining stress resilient modulus of graded crushed stone slowly increases,or minor decreases at the beginning and then slowly increases with increasing deviation stress at low stress state.Moisture content Clay Geotechnical engineering general200592&ensp&#0183&enspMy understanding of the optimum moisture content in clays was that it is the moisture content that will produce the best compaction.say OMC is 6% as for crushed stone base then you only allow range of 5.94 to 6.06%??? or is this just for subgrade? Still,if you have a sand subgrade with OMC = 11%,then you are in a zone of 10.9 to 11.1%
