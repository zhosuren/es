## A Repeated Loading Triaxial Test Study on Resilient
The RLT test results demonstrate that resilient modulus of graded crushed stone remarkably increases with decreasing moisture content and or increasing confining stress resilient modulus of graded crushed stone slowly increases,or minor decreases at the beginning and then slowly increases with increasing deviation stress at low stress state.Moisture content Clay Geotechnical engineering general200592&ensp&#0183&enspMy understanding of the optimum moisture content in clays was that it is the moisture content that will produce the best compaction.say OMC is 6% as for crushed stone base then you only allow range of 5.94 to 6.06%??? or is this just for subgrade? Still,if you have a sand subgrade with OMC = 11%,then you are in a zone of 10.9 to 11.1%

2017925&ensp&#0183&enspRelationship between maximum dry density and optimum moisture content of soil can be obtained from soil compaction curve obtained from Standard Proctor Compaction Test.This relationship helps in determining the optimum water content at which maximum dry density of soil can be attained through compaction.Fundamentals of Soil Compactionmoisture content at this maximum is called the optimum moisture content.3.6 Effects of increasing compactive effort Increased compactive effort enables greater dry unit weights to be achieved which because of the shape of the no air voids line must occur at lower optimum moisture contents.
