## Sodium Alginate &amp Spherifiion Kitchen Theory
Sodium alginate (a food product derived from brown algae or seaweed) is a thickening and gelling agent that forms heat stable gels in the presence of calcium.This property allows cooks to make gelled spheres,in a technique known as spherifiion.Sodium alginate has been used in the food industry for many years for the production of gellike foods for example,the pimento stuffing inAlginic acid WikipediaSodium alginate is the sodium salt of alginic acid.Its empirical formula is NaC 6 H 7 O 6.Sodium alginate is a gum,extracted from the cell walls of brown algae.Potassium alginate is a chemical compound that is the potassium salt of alginic acid.It is an extract of seaweed.Its empirical chemical formula is KC 6 H 7 O 6.E number: E400 (thic[ ]Sodium alginate is the sodium salt of alginic acid.Its empirical formula is NaC 6 H 7 O 6.Sodium alginate is a gum,extracted from the cell walls of brown algae.Potassium alginate is a chemical compound that is the potassium salt of alginic acid.It is an extract of seaweed.Its empirical chemical formula is KC 6 H 7 O 6.
