A centrifugal pump adapted to be positioned in a wellbore in an inverted position to pump fluids downhole includes a pump housing,a rotatable shaft positioned within the pump housing,at least one pump stage positioned within the pump housing,with each pump stage comprising an impeller connected to and fixed relative to the shaft,and a stationary diffuser,and an upthrust bearingCan A Centrifugal Pump Run Backward? Crane EngineeringPumps that have threaded impellers can unthread inside the casing when run in reverse.With tight clearances inside the casing,the impeller and shaft can act like a car jack on the pump internals.The impeller can be galled,casing damaged,thrust bearing and mechanical seal destroyed.
