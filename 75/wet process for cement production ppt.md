## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes a dry one and a wet one.Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century.Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement.The materials that are commonly used are limestone,shells,chalk,shale,clay,slate,silica sand,and iron ore.Cement Process &amp Energy Saving ECCJCement Production Process Raw Material section Clinker Burning section Finishing section Lepol Kiln Ordinary Kiln Long Kiln SP NSP Kiln WHB Suspension preheater Wet Process Dry Process Limestone Clay Slag Silica Crusher Dryer Figure 1 Cement Production Process Dry Powder Mixer Weigher Raw Mill Blending Silo Weigher Water Raw Mill Slurry tank
