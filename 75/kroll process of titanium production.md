## Producing titaniumbased alloys — Science Learning Hub
The main production process for titanium metal is known as the Kroll Process.In this process,the main ore,known as rutile,is treated with chlorine gas to produce titanium tetrachloride.This is then purified and reduced to a metallic titanium sponge by reaction with magnesium or sodium.The titanium sponge then undergoes an alloying and melting process.Some recent innovations in the Kroll process of titaniumThe original Kroll process,however,has undergone several modifiions in the past few decades.The recent technological breakthroughs in the Kroll process as well as in the magnesium recycling technology has resulted in a significant reduction in the production cost of the metal.

## Titanium was discovered in 1790 by William Gregor,a
The commercial production of titanium started in the 1950s based on the Kroll process and developed rapidly.Production of titanium grew from 75 tons in 1951 to 6000 tons in 1957.However,as the USA space programme provided the impetus for the growth of titanium production,so the radical change in policy and consequent drop in demand caused aextraction of titaniumTitanium is made by a batch process.In the production of iron,for example,there is a continuous flow through the Blast Furnace.Iron ore and coke and limestone are added to the top,and iron and slag removed from the bottom.This is a very efficient way of making something.With titanium,however,you make it one batch at a time.
