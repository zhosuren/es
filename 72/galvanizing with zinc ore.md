## Zinc Boliden
A thin layer of zinc known as galvanizing extends the lifetime of steel structures by preventing corrosion for 50 to 100 years.This means the consumption of iron ore and major carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced and society's investments in infrastructure become more enduring.Galvanizing of Steel IspatGuruGalvanizing of steel means appliion of zinc on the steel for corrosion protection.The major types of commercially available methods for applying zinc coatings are hot dip galvanizing,continuous galvanizing process,electrogalvanizing,zinc plating,mechanical plating,zinc spraying,and zinc painting.

## Zinc Bearish Price Action Leads To Production Cuts
Zinc ore must be concentrated before smelters can treat it.Concentration generally occurs at the mine site in order to keep transportation costs down.Typically,zinc concentrates contain 55% zinc with some copper,lead and iron contained.Zinc concentrates are then roasted and sintered using hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical techniques.Photos of Natural Zinc Ore,zinc minerals and specimens20131127&ensp&#0183&enspHistorically,much of the world's production of zinc came from the United States,Germany,and Belgium.For many years,the chief zinc ore producing country was the United States.The percentage of zinc in the ore mined is frequently very low,and often averages 3 per cent.but this is increased by concentration.
