## Understanding the Density of Concrete Aggregate Research
Lightweight aggregates will continue to soak up moisture for weeks after being wetted for the curing process.Therefore,concrete losing its mix water to the "thirsty" aggregates during the curing process can cause color variation,mottling,and "surface crazing," small networks of surface cracks that occur during the early drying process.Application Process National Institute of Environmental. · The above materials must be submitted posted online by March 1 to receive consideration for the following summer.Individual applications may be updated revised at any time up until March 1 during that year's application process.If you have previously applied,you must fill out a new application and provide new reference letters each year.
