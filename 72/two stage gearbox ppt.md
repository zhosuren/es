## Tutorial: Calculation of a planetary gear train Mesys AG
Tutorial: Calculation of a planetary gear train This tutorial shows the usage of MESYS shaft calculation with shaft systems.A twostage planetary gear stage is defined using the program.Please start with the tutorial for shaft calculation to see how to introduce geometry and supports for single shafts.The model is built in two steps.How the transmission works How a Car WorksFrontwheeldrive cars use the same transmission principles as rearwheeldrive cars,but the mechanical components vary in design according to the engine and gearbox layout.Transverse engines are normally mounted directly above the gearbox,and power is transmitted through the clutch to the gearbox by a train of gears.
