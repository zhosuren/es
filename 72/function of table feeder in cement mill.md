## Ball Mill Feeders Mineral Processing &amp Metallurgy
The entire mill feed enters the drum via a chute or spout and an internal spiral carries the feed into the trunnion liner.The drum feeder may be used in lieu of a spout feeder when headroom limits direct spouting.The drum also provides a convenient method of adding grinding balls to a ball mill.The drum is generally lined with Manganese Steel.Bond Index Ball Mill Rod Mill BT 100 XL RETSCHPlease note: *depending on feed material and instrument configuration settings Function Principle The ball and the rod mill basically have the same concept comprising either a 12x12'' jar with grinding balls or a 12x24'' jar with grinding rods.
