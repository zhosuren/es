## Underground Mining,Underground Mining Equipment
Underground mining is carried out when the rocks,minerals,or precious stones are loed at a distance far beneath the ground to be extracted with surface mining.To facilitate the minerals to be taken out of the mine,the miners construct underground rooms to work in.Longwall Mining Overview Introduction underground COALLONGWALL MINING Overview.In the method of secondary extraction known as longwall mining a relatively long mining face (typically in the range 100 to 300m but may be longer) is created by driving a roadway at right angles between two roadways that form the sides of the longwall block,with one rib of this new roadway forming the longwall face.

The method of surface mining was first recorded being used in the Healy River area where it is still in use by the Usibelli Coal Mine.

Underground Coal Mining.Underground mining involves opening one or more portals or shafts into the earth that follow or intercept coal seams that are too deep for surface mining methods.Two main methods of underground mining are practiced in Pennsylvania: RoomandPillar: Generally used for seams that are relatively flat or gently dipping.AsCoal Mining Methods EMFICoal Mining Methods Underground Mining Longwall &amp Room and Pillar Mining Longwall mining and roomandpillar mining are the two basic methods of mining coal underground,with roomandpillar being the traditional method in the United States.Both methods are well suited to extracting the relatively flat coalbeds (or coal seams) typical of

## Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia US EPA
Coal is mined in Appalachia by both surface and underground mining techniques.Surface coal mining methods in the steep terrain of the central Appalachian coalfields include mountaintop removal,contour,area and highwall mining.Coal mining operations are found inA Medley of Potpourri: Coal miningWhen coal seams are near the surface,it may be economical to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast,open pit,mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods.Open cast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods,as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited.This

There are hardrock underground mines,and there are softrock underground mines.Coal deposits,for instance,live in relatively soft sedimentary rock.Gold deposits live in igneous or metamorphic rock,which is relatively hard,as do diamonds,copper,silver,nickel and zinc [source: Great MiningAppendix F: Underground Coal Mining Methods andUnderground Coal Mining Methods and Engineering Dust Controls.An underground mine consists of the portals (entrance and exits to the mines),mains,submains,panels,and working faces.The panels are the working sections of the production operation.Depending on the mining method,a working section can have one or more working faces.
