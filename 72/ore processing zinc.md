## How zinc is made material,used,parts,components
2 Zinc can be produced by a process called froth flotation,which is also used for reduction of copper and lead ores.This process involves grinding the zinc ore to a fine powder,mixing it with water,pine oil,and flotation chemicals,and then agitating the mixture to &quotfloat&quot the zinc to the surface.Equipment for Zinc Ore Crushing Processing Plant in South2018830&ensp&#0183&enspZinc ore crushing plant is very popular in South Africa,and more and more people have gained much profit in zinc ore crushing industry,SBM as a famous mining manufacturer in the world which can give you the best quality equipment and best service.

## Zinc smelting Wikipedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals,e.g.iron,because in contrast,zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals,zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost,unless specificZinc Essential Chemical IndustryHowever,any iron sulfide present in the ore will be converted to iron(III) oxide,which reacts with zinc oxide to form zinc ferrite: In the simple leaching process,this zinc cannot be easily recovered and so ores with low iron content are preferable.The sulfur dioxide is often converted to sulfuric acid in a plant adjacent to the smelter.
