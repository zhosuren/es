The coulombic efficiency of nickel cadmium is over 80% for a fast charge but can drop to below 50% for slow charging.The sealed nickelcadmium cell can be stored in the charged or discharged state without damage.It can be restored for service by recharging several charge discharge cycles.Charging NickelCadmium Batteries Battery UniversityBU407: Charging Nickelcadmium.Learn how to maximize charge,minimize heat and reduce memory.Nickelbased batteries are more complex to charge than Liion and lead acid.

## Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Nickelcadmium (NiCd) batteries were the chemistry of choice for a wide range of highperformance appliions between 1970 and 1990.Recently,they were replaced by lithiumion (Liion) and nickelmetal hydride (NiMH) chemistries in most appliions.NiCAD vs.NiMH Batteries ServoCityNiCad (NickelCadmium) and NiMH (NickelMetal Hydride) are two very different types of batteries.Both types must be handled differently from one another in regards to charging and discharging procedures and philosophies.In general,NiMH batteries cannot handle the high rate of charges or discharges (typically over 1.52 amps) that NiCad batteries can.
