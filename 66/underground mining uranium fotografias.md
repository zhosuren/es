## How Uranium Mining Works HowStuffWorks
After locating uranium deposits and obtaining appropriate permits,a company will begin to mine.There are a few ways to extract uranium from the ground: open pit mining,underground mining and in situ recovery.Mining methods depend on the type of deposit,whether it's suspended in water and the geography of the area.How Underground Mining Works HowStuffWorksUnderground mines are the alternative to surface mines.Surface mines excavate from the top down,a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association,De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper uranium mines can reach 6,500 feet,or 2 kilometers.

## Potential Human Health Effects of Uranium Mining.
Uranium mining and processing are associated with a wide range of potential adverse human health risks.Some of these risks arise out of aspects of uranium mining and processing specific to that enterprise,whereas other risks apply to the mining …Conventional Mining Uranium Producers of AmericaMining uranium involves the same processes used to mine many other metals.Depending on the deposit,uranium is mined in one of three ways.Deposits close to the surface can be recovered using the open pit mining method.Underground mining methods are used for deep deposits.

Because of this,uranium extraction is used to isolate and purify the uranium containing compounds from the raw ore.This paper will focus on the chemistry of uranium leaching techniques,with a brief discussion of mining methods such as open pit mining and underground mining.Underground and Open Pit MiningUranium: How is it Mined? New Mexico Institute of Mining.Uranium mining is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground.The worldwide production of uranium in 2015 amounted to 60,496 tonnes.Kazakhstan,Canada,and Australia are the top three producers and together account for 70% of world uranium production.Other important uranium producing countries in excess of 1,000 tons per year are Niger,Russia,Namibia,Uzbekistan,China,…

## Uranium processing Canadian Nuclear Association
Uranium milling After mining,uranium ore is transported to a nearby mill for processing.The first step is to crush the ore and mix it with water so that it can move through a series of mill circuits.After crushing,the ore is treated with acid in large tanks,to separate the uranium from other minerals in the rock.The uranium is now part of a liquid solution,which is then separated from.what are underground uranium mine equipmentMining: Making the Most of Radioactive Caches How Uranium.Underground mining calls for venturing deeper into underground mine systems,where miners use shafts or adits (vertical and horizontal tunnels) to move equipment and position workers throughout the mine.
