## formula in computing cement gravel and sand
The formula for concrete mix is one part cement,two parts sand and three parts gravel or crushed stone.If hand mixing,it''s inadvisable to exceed a water to cement ratio of 0.55,which translates to 55 pounds of water for every 100 pounds of cement.When mixing concrete,it''s necessary to ensure that there is an adequate amount of aggregate.concrete What water:cement:sand ratio gives the20191123&ensp&#0183&enspThicker concrete for things like foundations and larger mass concrete is usually a 'weaker' mix of 1:3:6 which is one cement,3 sharp washed sand and 6 gravel crushed stone.In all concrete just enough water should be added until the mix folds nicely off the paddles tines inside the mixer.
