## Dry Grinding VS Wet Grinding Mineral Processing &amp Metallurgy
The choice between wet and dry milling is,in general,unimportant in smallscale milling but is a major technical problem when largescale milling in the metallurgical industries is involved.On purely mechanical grounds it is difficult to see any great difference in fundamental principles between wet and dry milling,since dry milling may be regarded as wet milling with a fluid having theSulphur Grinding Mill,Manufacturer &amp Exporters,SulphurSINGHASINI manufacturer of Sulphur Grinding Mill provide an automatic,comparatively explosion &amp dust free system for medium to fine grinding in inert gas nitrogen atmosphere for Sulfur.The MILLING operation is performed on the principle of attrition and compression,which results due to the centrifugal force generated from the suspended Rollers running inside a stationary Bull Ring.
