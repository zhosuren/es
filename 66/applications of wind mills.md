## How Do Wind Turbines Work? Department of Energy
Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity.Wind turns the propellerlike blades of a turbine around a rotor,which spins a generator,which creates electricity.Wind is a form of solar energy caused by a combination of three concurrent events:Wind Energy,Wind Power,Wind Farm and Wind Turbine2019521&ensp&#0183&enspWind turbines can be used as standalone appliions,or they can be connected to a utility power grid or even combined with a photovoltaic (solar cell) system.For utilityscale sources of wind energy,a large number of wind turbines are usually built close together to form awind plant.
