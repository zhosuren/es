extracted from ore by smelting raw iron was refined by primary smithing and was then manufactured into artefacts by (secondary) smithing.All these processes&nbspHow iron is made material,manufacture,making,historyBecause iron was a far superior material for the manufacture of weapons and tools than any other known metal,its production was a closely guarded secret.However,the basic technique was simple,and the use of iron gradually spread.As useful as it was compared to other materials,iron had disadvantages.

## Managing ore variability in iron ore processing CSIRO Research
Oct 4,2017 We can help you minimise the impact of shortterm variability in deposits for iron ore processing.From ore to steel ArcelorMittalCoal is cleaned of impurities in a coke furnace,yielding an almost pure form of carbon.A mixture of iron ore and coal is then heated in a blast furnace to produce molten iron,or pig iron,from which steel is made.ArcelorMittal has a diversified fleet of production facilities to make steel,both basic oxygen furnaces and electric arc furnaces.
