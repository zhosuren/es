## Compressive strength Wikipedia
The compressive strength of concrete is given in terms of the characteristic compressive strength of 150 mm size cubes tested at 28 days (fck).The characteristic strength is defined as the strength of the concrete below which not more than 5% of the test results are expected to fall.copper ores an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe copper ores being mined in 2010 are too lean in copper (0.5 2% Cu) to be Flotation is preceded by crushing and grinding the mined Cu ore into small.is soft and thus it&#39s usually alloyed with other metals to produce more strength.
