## Compressive Strength of Concrete Cube Test,Procedure.
cube size is 150x150x150,because it has been set as standard size,the value of compressive strength of which has been standardized at 28 days.We can also use 200mm cube,but you have to convert the compressive strength of 200mm cube to the equivalent of 150mm cube to know the actual strength of the concrete.In concrete compression test,normally 150mm x150mm x150mm.However,if the designed concrete strength is 100MPa,under the same force (about 2,000kN) supplied by the machine,the stress under a 150mmx150mmx150mm cube is not sufficient to crush the concrete cube.Therefore,100mmx100mmx100mm concrete cubes are used instead to increase the applied stress to crush the concrete cubes.

## Compressive Strength Test of Concrete Detailed Guide
Assume,the approx weight of one concrete cube = 8 kg Then the volume of concrete = 0.15 x 0.15 x 0.15 = 0.0033 cum; So for 1 cum = 8 0.0033 = 2400 kg cum Since the concrete weight itself has also been assumed for the structural calculations,if it exceeds the assumed value,then the load on the structure will likely increase.
