Effect of w c ratio To study the effect of leaching on cement pastes with different w c ratios,hydrated microstructures were created for neat cement pastes with w c.Factors Affecting the Shrinkage of Concrete Concrete,The quality of cement pate is dependent on the water cement ratio Higher the w c ratio,greater the shrinkage,thus it can be said that for a given aggregate content the shrinkage of concrete is a function of the water cement ratio The effect of water cement ratio on the shrinkage is shown in Fig 168

the amount of water required for complete hydration is about 40% of the weight of portland cement.in other words the wc ratio should be 0.40 for complete hydration.experiments have indied that the strength of concrete is inversely proportional to the wc ratio.therefore,a concrete should contain the minimum amount of water that gives it the required workabilityHow to Calculate Water Cement Ratio in Design of Concrete Mix?The lower value of the above three values is adopted as W C ratio for mix design Hence our w c ratio is 039 Water cement ratio is the most important factor which can affect the properties of concrete in the plastic stage as well as hardened stage So always be careful while selecting the w c ratio

## Water cement ratio Wikipedia
The water cement ratio is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of cement used in a concrete mix A lower ratio leads to higher strength and durability,but may make the mix difficult to work with and form Workability can be resolved with the use of plasticizers or super plasticizers Often,the ratio refers to the ratio of water to cementitious materials,w cm Cementitious.Physico mechanical behaviour of sandcrete block,The functional dependence of compressive strength of sandcrete prototype blocks at 05 W C on,water cement ratio and age on the strength of sandcrete.

Under standard conditions,an increase in W C ratio would generally lead to a fall in the concrete strength However,in hot weather,water addition would not give the same result This quantity of additional water can offer sufficient moisture to the hydration process to,
